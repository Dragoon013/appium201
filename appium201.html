                    <p>Before we go into the different parts we need to include in a script, let's talk about our training environment.</p>
                    <p>First off, we'll be working in a VM provided by ReadyTech today. If you have any problems during the course of labs, I will be able to go into your instance and help you out. You can just notify me using the ReadyTech instance to tell me that you need help.</p>
                    <p>We're also going to be working in Eclipse today. In Eclipse, we have set up the scripts within a framework called TestNG, for Java, that allows us to run the scripts with all of the dependencies it needs very easily.</p>
                    <p>That within that framework, there is a library, or build tool, called Maven that we are using to grab our dependencies, bundle them together, and then run our script.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the course today, the way we will run our tests is by using the "Maven test" command, which should compile all of our resources and dependencies together, and run it for us.</p>
                    <p>For those of you who may not have used Eclipse before, when you type in a line that does not have the right syntax, it will generally underline the offending line or part of the line that you need to fix, in red. If you simply hover or select that part of the line, Ecplise will give you suggestions on how to fix the problem.</p>

                    <p>In addition to to those frameworks in libraries, we'll be using the Appium Server GUI to faciliate testing on our local readytech machine. We'll also be setting up an Android Emulator that we will install and test our application on.</p>

                    <p>One last thing before we continue, we won't be testing any iOS applications today. This is due to the limitations of the training environment. So just to be clear, we can test on iOS devices and test iPhone applicaitons with Sauce Labs. The problem lies with the "local" lab environment.</p>
                    <p>That's not to say I won't go over iOS at all though. I'll be showing iOS examples alongside Android examples throughout the course..</p>

                    <p>They support two very large open source projects, namely Selenium and Appium. Selenium is used for Desktop and mobile browser testing, while Appium is used for native and hybrid application testing.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs provides environments that run your Selenium or Appium tests on any browser and OS combination you like - and they have over 500 combinations thereof. (if you include the different browser versions)</p>

		  <h3>Sauce Labs History</h3>
		  <p>Founded in 2008, by Steven Hazel, John Dunham, and Jason Huggins (Co-creator of Selenium).</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 30px">
  "Our purpose is to revolutionize testing
         so that development teams
     are free to innovate and deliver
        amazing applications—faster."</span></pre>
                    </p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Sauce Labs was founded in 2008 by Jason Huggins, co-creator of Selenium (the open source standard for automated testing frameworks) and Steve Hazel, current CTO. They set out to create a cloud-based platform for automated testing to free development teams from the hassle and cost of testing so they can focus on innovating their core capabilities.
                      </p>
<!-- No need to talk about this anecdote.                      <p>In an interview, Jason said the inspiration for starting Sauce labs came when he was working as a QA consultant. He was using Selenium to do browser testing, and the process of testing the apps in different browsers was taking too long. The problem was that all the testing was being done on one machine, so he split the tests onto 4 different machines, effectively running the tests in parallel, which cut the time drastically. Which is precisely what Sauce Labs does today.</p> -->

		  <h3>CI/CD Cycle</h3>
                  <img src="assets/images/sauceCI2.png" style="border:0; text-align:center; background:none;">
                  <p style="text-align:center;">Continuous Integration/Continuous Development</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Sauce Labs' value as a time saver is apparent even in its role in Continuous Integration and Delivery. </p>
                    <p>Traditionally, testing and QA are bottlenecks for application delivery and release. Writing automated tests, maintaining testing infrastructure, painful manual testing, all consume huge amounts of time. The work is never done either, because the product is always changing.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs takes away those worries though. With Selenium and Appium testing, we remove the barrier of time consuming test writing, and with Sauce Labs itself, we remove the need to have a propietary infrastructure. Sauce Labs provides the infrastructure for you, allowing you to test on a variety of platforms in a speedy manner. So you can focus on development, and releases,and leave the testing to Sauce Labs.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs reduces the pain of testing, so that instead of traditionally waiting until the end of the development life cycle to test, you can test iteratively, as you go through each step of development.</p>

		  <h3>What is Appium?</h3>
                  <p>Open source mobile application automation framework developed in 2011 by Dan Cuellar, the Test Manager at Zoosk.</p>
				  <p>Uses UIAutomation Framework to run in real time like an interpreter.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simulate mobile gestures</li>
                    <li>Automate Mobile Application Testing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Appium was developed in 2011 when Dan Cuellar wasn't satisfied with the current landscape of mobile testing tools. Dan came up with the idea of running Apple's UIAutomation framework as a real time interperter and used Apple utilities to execute shell commands, ordered text files to recieve commands, evaluate the output, execute said commands, and write them to disc using Python.</p>
                    <p>Then he created a C# version of the program, which mimicked Selenium-style syntax to sequentially order javascript commands and the first iteration of Appium was born.</p>
                    <p>Dan then presented his project at the Selenium Conference in 2012 and caught the attention of Jason Huggins. Jason and Dan worked together to release the source code and then present the project at the Mobile Testing Summit of 2013. Not long after, Sauce Lab fully backed Dan's project, changed the name to Appium and the rest is history.</p>

		  <h3>Local vs. Sauce Labs Appium Tests</h3>

                  <div style="float:left;width:50%;" class="centered">
                    <p>Local:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Requires Appium Server running locally or remotely</li>
                        <li>iOS development requires Xcode tools</li>
                        <li>Need all the libraries and images to run device simulators/emulators</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div style="float:right;width:50%;padding-right:0px;">
                    <p>Sauce Labs:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Appium server is remote and provisioned for you</li>
                      <li>Real and virtual devices provisioned</li>
                      <li>Parallelization</li>
                      <li>Record Results</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In general, no Appium test is going to be strictly "local". Running any kind of Appium test requires the use of the Appium Server, which acts as a middleman between the test commands and the emulator or simulator.</p>
                    <p>You can test android on any OS, (windows, Mac OSX, linux). But testing iOS applications requires a Mac OSX operating system.
		    <p>Android itself requires the SDK, and a lot of other helpful libraries and frameworks as well.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs handles all of that device management for you. They run an Appium Server themselves, provide multiple mobile OS, version, and type combinations, and rent it out to their customers to run their Appium tests on. </p>

                    <li>Tunnels: The tunnels tab will list out all of secure tunnels that are currently enabled and running between Sauce Labs and your local machine.</li>
                    <li>Account Details: Lastly, our account details page is important. You can see your VM usage, as well as find your access key, which is required for authentication when using Sauce Labs. We'll go into how to use it later on.</li>

                  <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
                  <p>The traditional method of testing applications and sites.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Testing Locally</li>
                    <li>Sauce Labs Manual Tests</li>
                  </ul>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Do the demo on Android!!! It will go faster than iOS.</p>

                    <p>Traditionally, once your mobile browser application was ready to be tested, you would load it onto a physical device, and then test it with your own fingers. There are a few problems with that, namely, it takes a lot of time to do and you're limited to the devices you have. So then you can run your test manually on an emulator or simulator to take care of the device problem. But the issue of time, of someone physically clicking on the device emulator or phyiscally touching the device is a big problem.</p>
                    <p>With Sauce Labs, you can run manual tests without having to set up the infrastructure locally. This can help you with memory issues you may run into running simulators and emulators on your own local machine, and can give you a good way test out a mobile browser application on more devices than you could easily do locally.</p>
		    <p><mark>Do not mention what is below this - for instructor knowledge.</mark></p>
		    <p>One thing to note about manual testing with Sauce Labs - you can't start a manual test with an application preloaded. There are a couple ways to get around this though. If you start a normal automated test, you can interrupt it, and take control of the app. And if you use Sauce Connect Proxy, then you can interact with a local emulator you may be running, that can have your app installed on it.</p>
                    <p>Manual Test Demo: </p>

		  <h3>Appium Nuts and Bolts</h3>
                  <div style="text-align:center;">
                    <img src="assets/images/AppiumGears.png" style="border:0; background:none; width:50%">
                  </div>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Android UIAutomator and iOS UIAutomation Frameworks</li>
                   <li>Appium Client Libraries (extends Selenium Webdriver)</li>
                   <li>Appium Server</li>
                   <li>Appium GUI</li>
                 </ul>
                 <aside class="notes">
                   <p>Appium's architecture was developed with a few things in mind.</p>
		   <ol>
                     <li>You shouldn't have to recompile or modify your app to automate it</li>
                     <li>You shouldn't be restricted to a specific language or framework to write and run your tests</li>
                     <li>Appium shouldn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to automation APIs</li>
                     <li>Appium should be open source</li>
                   </ol>
		   
                   <p>First, you shouldn't have to recompile or modify the core appliaction code that you are working with. In addition, no one wants to learn yet another proprietary language, and then test an application that contains test code within it - which can change the nature of the app!</p>
		   <p>Plus, there are already automation framworks out there, designed by the people who made the devices that you are testing on - Apple and Google.</p>
		   <p>In order to actually use the automation frameworks, the Selenium Webdriver wraps them both in one API, which is then wrapped by the Appium client libraries. So the vendor automation frameworks provide the ability to carry out the automated interactions, and the Selenium WebDriver provides the communication architecture.</p>
                   <p>This is what gives Appium it's client/server architecture.</p>
                   <p>The appium client is simply a library that you can use to write Appium test scripts in your favorite language. These client libraries are extensions of the Selenium WebDriver client, so they should have all the same functionalities, as well as syntax.</p>
		   
		   <p>The Appium server is a Node.js server that has an exposed REST API. It connects with the client, accepts commands, executes those commands on a mobile device, and then passes the results of those commands back in an HTTP response. The client/server architecture gives us a lot of freedom. It allows us to run the the server on a different machines than where we run our tests. This also allows Sauce Labs to run tests for you on their cloud service.</p>
                   <p>The Appium GUI is wrapped around an appium server, which means we don't have to worry about having Node installed on our system. It will come bundled with everything it needs to start up the server itself.</p>

                    <p>Appium interacts with Android devices by using the UI Automator framework that was developed by Google to run it's own automation tasks on devices. Appium enables you to run tests in whatever language you want, not just the java of the framework. It also allows you to run your tests on remote devices/emulators. We can also use the UI Automator syntax directly in ur appium scripts to locate elements.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>The UI Automation tool was written by Apple to interact with iOS applications. Testing scripts written using the UI Automation tool proper use JavaScript, which then calls the UI Automation API to simulate interaction. Appium wraps itself around this API, converting your own Appium test scripts into JavaScripts that the UI Automation tool uses to interact with the application.We can also use the UI Automation syntax directly in our Appium scripts to locate elements.</p>

                 <aside class="notes">
                   <p>If you use a Mac OS regularly, then you can do both android and iOS testing locally. The android set will be pretty much the same, just with some tweaks to fit in with standard mac program installations.</p>
                   <p>But testing your iOS app on mac requires the XCode tools, the iOS SDKs, and you need to authorize your computer to run the iOS simulator.</p>
                   <p>Recommend Mac OS X 10.10</p>
		   <p><mark>Only talk about the auth if asked.</mark></p>
                    <p>Authorize: You need to authorize use of the iOS Simulator by running the authorize-ios binary made available through npm. If you installed globally, by running npm install -g appium, use
                      <pre style="display:inline;">sudo authorize-ios</pre>
                      If you installed locally, the binary will be installed within the node_modules/.bin directory, so use <pre style="display:inline;">sudo node_modules/.bin/authorize-ios</pre>
                      # alternatively
                      <pre style="display:inline;">sudo $(npm bin)/authorize-ios</pre>
                      If you are running Appium.app, you can authorize iOS through the GUI. You need to do this every time you install a new version of Xcode.</p>

                    <p>There are three different types of mobile applicaitons that require different kinds of test setups.</p>
                    <p>Mobile Web browser - these types of tests simply pull up your application on a mobile browser, like mobile chrome, FF, safari.</p>
                    <p>Native app - native app testing goes into the application itself, and works with the native or inherent application elements, rather than using a browser or webview to access your application site.</p>
                    <p>Hybrid app - Native app that has a bar on the top, bottom, and then pulls up/uses a webview. </p>
                    <p>All three of these require various settings in your test, with regards to Desired Capabilities. We'll examine those later on.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>So we went over how appium works on high level, but let's cover the process.</p>
                    <p>First, we need to actually write our test script. When we go to run it, the Appium Client library that we used to will connect and send the commands to the local or remote appium server. Our script and the commands we write in it all talk to the REST API on the Appium server, via HTTP requests.</p>
                    <p>The appium server then sends those commands to the device, and then collects and sends the results back via and HTTP response.</p>
                    <p>Our script then takes those results, and it's up to us to pass those results onto Sauce Labs, or deal with them locally.</p>
                    <p>If we run this test using Sauce Labs, then one more additional step will be done, which is to create the test records, so the video recording, screenshots, and logs.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>For those of you who may have done local Selenium testing, some of these Desired Capabilities may look unfamiliar. One key difference between selenium and Appium is that Appium requires an Appium webserver, even for local tests. We need to set these desired capabilties so the client can tell the server what settings we want to test with.</p>
                      <p>The desired capabilities that we have here are all that are required for local Appium tests. When we run an Appium test using Sauce Labs, we will need to add additional capabilties, but we'll go over that in a couple modules.</p>
                      <p>In our case, we are going to be testing on the Android Emulator. We will also load up our app from github onto that device and run our test on it.</p>
                      <p>There are quite a few desired capabilities we can set, and we'll take a look at some of them more in depth later. A key capability I want to point out here though is the "app" capability. You'll notice it goes to github.com to grab the app. We can set this to many different locations, and when doing local tests, it can point to somewhere in your filesystem as well. Sauce Labs also has their own application storage solution that can be used when running appium tests.</p>

                      <p>These two drivers both inherit from the general Appium driver class, and add in functions that are useful for testing in the context of their operating systems, such as the UIAutomation and UIAutomator classes, for iOS and Android, respectively.</p>
                      <p>These two examples we have here are both for starting tests with a local Appium Server and emulator/simulator.</p>
                      <p>Note that the URL goes to localhost:4723, which is the default address for a local appium server. The driver object stores the URL to pass along commands to, and also passes along the capabilities the test needs.</p>

                      <p>These are the different kinds of drivers that are generally available, when testing with Appium or even Selenium. It's important to know the differences between them.</p>
                      <p>RemoteWebDriver: This driver class comes directly from Selenium. Since Appium operates on the client-server model, Appium uses this to initialize a driver session. However, since we are doing mobile testing, using the RemoteWebDriver is not recommended since there are other drivers available that offer additional features or convenience functions.</p>

                      <p>AppiumDriver: This driver class inherits from the RemoteWebDriver class, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test through the Appium server.</p>

                      <p>AndroidDriver: This driver class inherits from AppiumDriver, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test on Android devices through Appium. Only use this driver class if you want to start a test on an Android device or Android emulator.</p>

                      <p>IOSDriver: This driver class inherits from AppiumDriver, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test on iOS devices through Appium. Only use this driver class if you want to start a test on an iOS device or iOS emulator.</p>
                      <p>All over these Appium or mobile drivers build on the original Selenium RemoteWebDriver, and then add in their own additional functionalities.</p>

		      <p>For those of you who have used selenium, or do web developement, you're probably familiar with the inspector for browser, and how you can find and identify html objects or other web elements by inspecting the page. But what is the equivalent for inspecting and application? The answer is pretty much just: XML. Now, the xml can be showen through the Appium GUI, if you can get that working. But you can always print out the pagesource as well. This will give you the hierarchy of the xml, and pretty much what the app knows exists on the current view.</p>
		      <p>In the white on the right, te XML gets rendered and parsed for you into a nice screen. On the left, I have a section of formatted output from the getpagesource() function, which we will take a look at using later.</p>

                      <p>The automation classes provide a way to collect or search for particular elements through the UI class.</p>
                      <p>We talked about the UI Automation and UI Automator frameworks a little earlier, and how we can identify elements using them. This is especially useful when a test needs some fine-grained control over finding elements.</p>
                      <p>For iOS mobile testing, the Appium server converts the WebDriver commands from your test script into the UIAutomation JavaScript commands that can be understood by Apple Instruments. These commands are then sent to your iOS mobile application and execute those commands against the application in the simulator or device.</p>
                    <p>For Android Appium tests that use the android automator framework, require the Appium Server to convert the test script commands into UIAutomator Java commands, parse the data when testing it against your mobile emulator of your choice, then convert the response back, and relay the data to the appium script</p>

                      <p>Those of you who have used selenium may be familiar with using a simple .click() on the end of an element. click() and tap() are pretty  much the same. In fact, when using the appium client library, the click() uses the underlying touch software to perform what is equivalent to a tap() touch.</p>

			<p>First thing we need to consider when writing out a new appium script is the desired capabilties. The desired capabilities are basically the settings we want to apply to the webdriver, which starts up and drives interaction with an emulator/simulator.</p>
			<p>With Appium, there are couple of different kinds of applications we can test, and in general ,you will need different sets of capabilities to run test you application successfully, depending on if you're running it remotely or locally.</p>
                      <p>We are going to be testing on the generic Android Emulator. We will also load up our app from github onto that device and run our test on it.</p>
                      <p>There are quite a few desired capabilities we can set, and we'll take a look at some of them more in depth later. A key capability I want to point out here though is the "app" capability. You'll notice it goes to github.com to grab the app. We can set this to many different locations, and when doing local tests, it can point to somewhere in your filesystem as well. Sauce Labs also has their own application storage solution that can be used when running appium tests.</p>

                      <p>These are the different kinds of drivers that are generally available, when testing with Appium or even Selenium. It's important to know the differences between them. These are the drivers that are important to know for Appium testing.</p>
                      <p>RemoteWebDriver: This driver class comes directly from Selenium. Since Appium operates on the client-server model, Appium uses this to initialize a driver session. All of the other drivers are pretty much built on top of this class.</p>

                      <p>AppiumDriver: This driver class inherits from the RemoteWebDriver class, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test through the Appium server.</p>

                      <p>AndroidDriver: This driver class inherits from AppiumDriver, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test on Android devices through Appium. Only use this driver class if you want to start a test on an Android device or Android emulator.</p>

                      <p>IOSDriver: This driver class inherits from AppiumDriver, but it adds in additional functions that are useful in the context of a mobile automation test on iOS devices through Appium. Only use this driver class if you want to start a test on an iOS device or iOS emulator.</p>

                      <p>The UIAutomator language is the Android specific automation framework, made by Google. The Appium java client library can take in a form of the native UIautomator syntax, and then uses that directly in the app to identify or interact with elements. The results then get converted and passed back to the appium script.</p>
                      <p>You can see in the top example we have an example of the native UIAutomator syntax. In the below example, we can see the appium script takes pieces of the original syntax in it's argument, which it will then use, in this case, to id a cancel button in our application.</p>

                      <p>Similar to android, one way we can find an element or set of elements in iOS is through the UIAutomation class name.

Hence, that is why fieldTwo is the name of our MobileElement variable.</p>
                        <p>For iOS the IDs are a little complicated. Appium will first search for an accessibility id that matches. If there is none found, a string match will be attempted on the element labels. Finally, if the id passed in is a localization key, it will search the localized string.</p>

                      <p>So first, we have a press(), which places a "finger" on the screen. In this particular case, we are giving it specific coordinates to press. But we could also pass it a webelement. Typically, we see these followed by a release(), which will withdraw the touch. I've inclduded the formal definition here, and it's important to note that you can use the element, and coordinates, or just coordinates or just an element. They can be used seperately. This will be true of the actions below this one as well.</p>
                      <p>The moveTo() works differently depending on what arguments it has. If it has just coordinates, then it will move the touch to a new position relative to the current position. So if we moved starting from (10,200), and did a moveTo(1,1), we would end up where?</p>
                      <p>Let them answer.</p>
                      <p>Good! If moveTo is just given an element, it will move the current touch to the center of the given element. And lastly if it has an element and coordinates, then it will move to that element, but the coordinate reference is set from the top left corner.</p>
                      <p>Another action we have is tap, which is pretty straightforward. It's essentially a combination of a press() and a release(), just a quick tap on your screen.</p>

                      <p>Appium performs the touchaction events in sequence. It's also referred to as "chaining". You can add a wait event to control the timing of the gesture.</p>
                      <p>The longPress works similarly to the other actions we've already seen, but unlike the regular press(), we can include a time argument. </p>
                      <p>And lastly, we have the perform() function. This is what starts the long chain that is defined in front of it. Which is why all of my actions have performs on the end of them!</p>
                      <p>It's generally best practice to create a new touch object for each touch sequence you make. So for every perform() you have, it should be done on a unique touchAction object.</p>
                      <p>There are few more additional ones that you can use, but these are some the more important ones you should keep in mind when starting to write your appium tests.</p>

                      <p>Multitouches require the MultiTouchAction class. The MultiTouchAction class takes in different touchaction objects, and then performs their actions.</p>
                      <p>You can see that multitouches work very similarly to touchactions, as multitouches are made up of touchaction objects! We can also see the same chaining we used before is also implemented here.</p>

                    <p>If you are working on hybrid testing, or if you are a testing a functionality of your native app that requires switching contexts, then you will need to know the swtichTo() function.</p>
                    <p>A context is generally going to be either a webview or your native application.</p>
                    <p>When working with a hybrid app, you can work with more than 1 webview. Generally, best practice is to get a list of the webviews that you have available, and then switch to the proper webview context by name.</p>

                    <p> There are many situations in which your test script may run ahead of the website or application you're testing, resulting in timeouts and a failing test. For example, you may have a dynamic content element that, after a user clicks on it, a loading appears for five seconds. If your script isn't written in such a way as to account for that five second load time, it may fail because the next interactive element isn't available yet. The general recommended solution for this is to use explicit waits.</p>

                    <p>Implicit and Explicit waits shouldn't be confused with TouchAction waits. the TouchAction waitAction() is actually waiting while doing an action, rather than waiting for an element to appear. It is for the touch, not the test.</p>

		    <p>So this application is a collection of a lot of different activities that allow us to try out all kinds of interactions. We're trying to reach an activity called "Touch Paint"</p>

		    <p>But the application isn't actually showing the element. If we just told it to tap or click on it, it wouldn't be able to find what we want. So we need to scroll down to it until it becomes visible.</p>
		    <p>scrollTo() is a WebDriver action - that is, it comes from the Selenium library, and will scroll down on the page until it finds an item that has the text string that is the argument.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>All Appium scripts call out to an Appium server. So you can think of them as all being remote, even if you are hosting the server on your own local machine. But if your script is going to talk to Sauce Labs, then it needs a couple of other additional items to be setup. First, we'll need to edit the "app" desired cap to point to where the application is hosted. Second, we'll need to authenticate with Sauce Labs. And lastly, we'll need to set additional desired capabilities, which defines what device and OS combination we will use, as well as the version of the OS and appium itself.</p>

                    <p>One thing to consider when setting up your testing environment or suite, is to use Environment Variables for your credentials or explicitly state them in your script.</p>
                    <p>Having environment variables with your credentials makes tests more re-usable among other team members. For example, they may be using their own credentials to log in and it doesn't run the risk of potential exposure of credentials.</p>

                      <p>With Sauce Labs, we can set up the script to run the test on several different platforms. We aren't limited to what we have locally. If we want to indicate more platforms combinations to test on, at the same time, we typically use a framework to enable that for us.</p>
                      <p>Similar to what we saw a couple slides back, these desired capabilities can have different values, depending on the kind of application you are testing. If you are planning on testing a web application, and not a native application, you won't need the "app" capability, and you can include the name of the browser you want to test on in the browsername capability. If you are testing a native applicaation, then you still will need the browserName capability, and will need to set it to an empty string.

                        <p>The reason why we set it to an empty string is to override the default, which is firefox, which comes from selenium. If we don't include the empty string, this can confuse the services, as it can read firefox before app, or simply just pass it information it doesn't need.</p>

                  <h3>What is a Testing Framework?</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A test automation framework is a scaffold comprised of libraries, dependecies, drivers, and helper scripts that facilitate the execution of Appium test scripts.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Parallelization</li>
                    <li>Assertions</li>
                    <li>Reporting</li>
                  </ul>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Ok, what does that mean? It's essentially just a bunch of additional libraries we can use in conjunction with our script for several cases:</p>
                    <li>Record your data: Frameworks often have, or can have a way for you to output the results of your test scripts for you, rather than writing them by hand</li>
                    <li>Talk to external applications: you can include external libraries in your framework to talk to and send results to places like Sauce Labs</li>

                  <h3>Test Driven Development vs. Behavior Driven Development</h3>
                  <p>TDD: A developer writes the test, and then writes code, and tests that code continuously, until the test passes.</p>
                  <p>BDD: A way to plan and develop code similar to TDD, but allows teams to include non-technical members when writing tests for scenarios and features</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In the QA/Test industry, there are a couple of different ways of thinking about how to develop applications with testing in mind. One of those is TDD, where you write a test, and then write the code until the test passes. Antoher variant is to plan the same kind of testing, but on a higher level, basically written in a more colloquial manner though.</p>
                    <p>TDD is also somewhat synonymous with "test first" development. BDD means writing tests that read like a book, almost in full sentences, so people can understand precisely what a test is trying to accomplish.</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                  <h3>TDD Planning Example</h3>
                  <p>Sauce_counter() needs to count the number of sauces inputted</p>
                  <p>Pasta_counter() needs to count the number of pastas inputted</p>
                  <p>sNpComparer() needs to compare the counts and make sure that they are equal</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of TDD, because we have idenfitfied features of the program that need to be made, and we have a function for each one, which details very explicity what each will do.</p>

                <section>
                  <h3>BDD Planning Example</h3>

                  <p>Feature: Pasta and Sauce Matchmaker</p>
                  <p>Scenario: Some sauces</p>
                  <ul><p>Given I have 5 different kinds of Sauce</p>
                  <p>When I have 5 different kinds of Pasta</p>
                  <p>Then my chef will be happy</p></ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of BDD, which uses the Given, When, Then, method of planning. It details the actual goals of what the application or feature needs to accomplishes, in terms of a user story, rather than explicit functions. In this method of planning, we are making sure that the end goal or the business objective will be accomplished.</p>

It's basically the test itself. If an assert fails, that generally means the test has failed as well.</p>

                      <p>There are a lot of different kinds of assertion checks that you can make. All asserts will cause a test to fail, if the check or comparison returns false.

                  <ul>
                    <li>Understand testing strategies for setting up automated testing</li>
                    <li>Label, name, and tag your tests to faciliate searching for past tests on Sauce Labs</li>

                  </div>
                     <div style="padding-top:10px;"><p><strong>Small:</strong> Tests should be short and succinct.</p>
                     <p><strong>Atomic:</strong> Tests should focus on testing a single feature.</p>
                     <p><strong>Autonomous:</strong> Tests should be independent of other tests.</p>
                   </div>

                     <aside class="notes">

                       <p>Short - If you have a test suite of 100 tests running concurrently on 100 VMs, then the time it will take to run the entire suite will be determined by the longest/slowest test case. Keeping your tests small ensures that your suite will run efficiently and provide you with results faster. </p>
                       <p>Atomic - The test makes clear exactly what it is that you're testing. If the test fails, then you should also have a very clear idea of what needs to be fixed. </p>
                       <p>Autonomous - Tests should not be dependent on the results of one test to run successfully. In addition, an autonomous test should use its own data to test against, and not create potential conflicts with other tests over the same data.  </p>

                       <p>Performance testing serves to answer questions such as, can your application server handle a particular load, and does it behave as expected when you push it to its limit? These types of tests are better undertaken with a testing infrastructure that has been specifically developed for performance testing, so all baseline performance metrics are well established and understood before you start the test.</p>

                      <li>Parallelization</li>
                      <li>Less expensive</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Beyond the highlevel testing types, theres what you're actually testing on. Should you test on real devices, or use a simulator/emulator?</p>
                    <p>There's a lot to be said for both!</p>
                    <p>You're going to find that your real device testing will be more expensive that testing on a simulator or emulator, whether you set it up yourself or not. It's also more difficult to set up for yourself. Of course, that can be mitigated by testing with Sauce Labs real devices. If you need to test how hardware responds or test hardware capabilities that your app uses, then real device testing is the way to go.</p>
                    <p>Testing on a Simulator or emulator is going to be easier to set up on your own though. With Sauce Labs, there's no set up at all, but also, your tests will be more reproducible. Sauce Labs spins up a completely new and clean emulator/simulator for every test you run. So you know you are starting from the same baseline everytime. With real devices, it's harder to get that clean slate every time you run a test.</p>
                    <p>There are a plethora of additional pros as well, including parallelization, cheaper cost to set up and buy, and setting particular options on a simulated device that isn't possible when testing on a real one.</p>

                     <ul>
                       <li>Code reuse across tests; reuse common element interactions</li>
                       <li>Abstraction: With product change, only change one piece of code</li>
                       <li>Cross-platform tests: abstract your application element objects that exist across iOS and Android</li>
                     </ul>
                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>
                         Sometimes we interact with particular elements in our application repeatedly. The nature of applications is that they change over time as well. Instead of writing the same code for the same interacctions, we can add a level of abstraction with page objects.
                       </p>
                       <p>Cross-platform: allows you to use the same tests when you have an app in both ios and android.</p>

                     <h3>Parallelization</h3>
                     <p>Avoid dependencies between tests</p>
                     <ul><li>If you chain tests together, when one at the top fails, then they will all fail</li></ul>
                     <p>Use Frameworks</p>
                     <ul><li>Frameworks include helpful libraries and functionality that can help you make the most of parallelization</li></ul>
                     <aside class="notes">

		       <p>Parallelizaiton is where Sauce Labs goes to work. Running in parallel - whether that's across platforms or running several tests at once - even both - is where testing and sauce labs gets really exciting. When we use the three best practices in test writing we talked about early -Short, atomic, and autonomous - then this goes really smoothly.</p>

		       <p><mark>extra knowledge/words:</mark></p>
                       <p>One of the main features that Sauce Labs offers is parallelization, the ability to run serveral scripts at once on a variety of platforms. Since tests and commands are sent remotely, these tests take longer to run individually, but with parallelization, we can run them all at once. That is, we can start them all at the same time, which cuts down on the total time tests would normally take, saving time and money for your teams and business.</p>
                       <p>It's good to avoid dependencies between tests. This goes along with the atomic testing strategy, where we want to create autonomous tests, so that they don't depend on each other, and when one fails, then we know exactly what failed</p>
